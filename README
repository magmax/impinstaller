Imp Installer is a python program that builds a TCL/TK program.

This TCL/TK program will be packed with a TCL interpreter and will allow to install your package.

There is no GUI to create the install package. You must learn some python in order to do that. This feature will give you all python power.

TCL scripts will be obtained from InstallJammer, so this ImpInstaller is as free as InstallJammer is. Use it, copy it, give a copy to your friends, re-sell it if you can, and enjoy it.
